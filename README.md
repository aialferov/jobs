# Jobs Service

[![License: MIT][MIT Badge]][MIT]
[![GitHub Release Badge]][GitHub Releases]

An HTTP service for converting JSON based tasks

## Usage

You can use [Docker] to run the service without any other dependency needed:

```
$ docker run --name jobs --rm -it -p 8080:8080 aialferov/jobs
```

After you have run the service you get into the service console. There you can
run commands to get some information about the service, for example about API it
provides or the API usage example.

### Without Docker

You will need [Erlang] installed in your system to build and run the service.

To build, run unit tests and run:

```
$ make
$ make check
$ make run
```

The latter runs executable that is located in "_build/default/bin" after build
and could be run directly:

```
$ _build/default/bin/jobs
```

Make targets provide many other functions for development and packaging cycle
including getting into an Erlang shell, joining a running service instance
Erlang VM, Docker image related operations and others.

Run "make usage" and "make docker-usage" to see them all.

### Kubernetes

To run the service as a [Kubernetes] deployment, just create it from the
manifest:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aialferov/jobs/master/manifests/jobs.yaml
```

When the pod is running you can attach to the service console:

```
$ POD=$(kubectl get po -l run=jobs -o jsonpath={.items[*].metadata.name})
$ kubectl attach -it $POD
```

You have to close the window as there is no other way to detach.

### Make Interface

[Make] interface is provided for operational purposes and is based on the [Mk]
project. Please refer the [Erlangbin.mk] and [Docker.mk] makefiles description
for details.
